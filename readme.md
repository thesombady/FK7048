# FK7048 - Mathematical methods II
This repository includes my notes, and my submissions for the course FK7048 at Stockholm University HT2023.

The section [recap](recap/main.pdf) includes a less extensive recap of the course which is used as study-material for the exam in the course.

The different folder handin($i$); $i \in [1,8]$. It includes topics such as Green's functions, Fourier transforms, solution methods to both 'generic' PDE's and ODE's. They have minor misstakes in them, however, they are mostly correct.
